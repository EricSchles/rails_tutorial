#Introduction to Ruby on Rails

Ruby on Rails is one of the defacto standards in the MVC world and for good reason.  It was revolutionary for it's time.  The ideas pinoeered in the rails framework are genius - web development doesn't have to be hard.  Rails takes this idea extremely seriously.  So seriously in fact, that I think they go slightly overboard.  The problem for me with rails is and has always been, things are a little too easy.  They've taken away all of the work, and thus taken away all of the understanding.  So the learning curve to beginner to expert is EXTREMELY steep.  That's why I'm writing this tutorial.  Not for the novice rails programmer and not for the expert.  But for the person in the middle.  The person who needs that little extra push.

##Some prerequistes

###Ruby
For those of you new to ruby, there are a lot of great tutorials.

If you know another language, like python (like me) well, this is a good intro:

[rails bridge](http://docs.railsbridge.org/intro-to-rails/ruby_language)

This tutorial will give you all the basics of ruby (but no fluff).  

If you are beginner to programming and want rails to be your new toy, I'd recommend going through this tutorial on ruby first:

[learn ruby the hard way](http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/)

If you want an advanced look at ruby I'd recommend monk:

[ruby monk](https://rubymonk.com/)

###Rails

I know I just mentioned railsbridge, but it's a really great high level intro generally:

[rails bridge](http://docs.railsbridge.org/intro-to-rails/ruby_language)

This is a great set of resources on rails, it's fairly in-depth, but not a book:

[rails guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/)

This is a pretty good free book on rails:
